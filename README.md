1. 🌳 Construct an AVL tree for a given set of elements which are stored in a file. And implement insert and delete operations on the constructed tree. Write contents of the tree into a new file using in-order.

   👉 For Solution [check here](AVLTree.java)

2. 📂 Construct B-Tree of order 5 with a set of 100 random elements stored in an array. Implement searching, insertion, and deletion operations.

3. 🏔️ Construct Min and Max Heap using arrays, delete any element, and display the content of the Heap.

4. 🔄 Implement BFT and DFT for the given graph, when the graph is represented by:  
   a) 📊 Adjacency Matrix  
   b) 🗂️ Adjacency Lists

5. 🖇️ Write a program for finding the biconnected components in a given graph.

6. ⚡ Implement Quick sort and Merge sort and observe the execution time for various input sizes (Average, Worst, and Best cases).

7. 🚀 Compare the performance of Single Source Shortest Paths using the Greedy method when the graph is represented by:  
   a) 📊 Adjacency Matrix  
   b) 🗂️ Adjacency Lists

8. 🕒 Implement Job Sequencing with deadlines using the Greedy strategy.

9. 🎒 Write a program to solve the 0/1 Knapsack problem using Dynamic Programming.

10. 👑 Implement the N-Queens Problem using Backtracking.

11. 🔙 Use Backtracking strategy to solve the 0/
